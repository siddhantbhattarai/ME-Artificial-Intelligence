## **🚀 What's Included**

The notebook demonstrates:
1. **ACO Algorithm Overview**:
   - Initialization of pheromone levels and ant positions.
   - Probabilistic path construction based on pheromone levels and heuristic values.
   - Pheromone update and evaporation.
2. **Example Use Case**:
   - Solving the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) for 5 cities.
3. **Visualization**:
   - Pheromone levels and optimal path.

## **🔧 Prerequisites**

Ensure you have the following installed:
- **Python (>= 3.7)**
- **Jupyter Notebook**
- Libraries: `numpy`, `matplotlib`

Install dependencies using:
```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib notebook
