## **📁 Project Structure**

- `Regularization.ipynb`: Contains the complete code, explanations, and examples for regularization techniques.

---

## **🚀 What's Included**

The notebook demonstrates the following:
1. **Ridge Regression (L2 Regularization)**: Reduces large coefficients and improves generalization.
2. **Lasso Regression (L1 Regularization)**: Performs feature selection by shrinking irrelevant feature coefficients to zero.
3. **Comparison of Performance Metrics**: Evaluation using `MAE`, `MSE`, and `R² Score`.

---

## **🔧 Prerequisites**

Ensure you have the following installed:
- **Python (>= 3.7)**
- **Jupyter Notebook**
- Libraries: `pandas`, `scikit-learn`, `numpy`

Install dependencies using:
```bash
pip install pandas scikit-learn numpy notebook
```

---

## **▶️ Running the Notebook**

1. Open the terminal and navigate to the folder containing the notebook.
2. Run the following command:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```
3. Open `Regularization.ipynb` in the browser and run each cell.

## **📊 Performance Metrics Explained**

- **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**: Measures the average magnitude of errors.
- **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**: Penalizes larger errors by squaring them.
- **R² Score**: Represents the proportion of variance in the target variable explained by the model.

## **📝 Example Code Overview**

The notebook demonstrates:
- Dataset creation and preprocessing.
- Train-test split to ensure a balanced dataset.
- Implementation of Ridge and Lasso regression.
- Performance evaluation using test data.
