## **📁 Project Structure**

- `Particle_Swarm_Optimization.ipynb`: Contains the complete Python implementation, explanations, and visualization of the PSO algorithm.

---

## **🚀 What's Included**

The notebook demonstrates:
1. **PSO Algorithm Overview**:
   - Initialization of particles with random positions and velocities.
   - Update of personal and global best positions.
   - Velocity and position updates based on cognitive and social components.
2. **Example Use Case**:
   - Minimization of the function \( f(x) = (x - 5)^2 \) (global minimum at \( x = 5 \)).
3. **Visualization**:
   - Convergence plot showing the best score over iterations.

---

## **🔧 Prerequisites**

Ensure you have the following installed:
- **Python (>= 3.7)**
- **Jupyter Notebook**
- Libraries: `numpy`, `matplotlib`

Install dependencies using:
```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib notebook
```

---

## **▶️ Running the Notebook**

1. Open the terminal and navigate to the folder containing the notebook.
2. Run the following command:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```
3. Open `Particle_Swarm_Optimization.ipynb` in the browser and run each cell.

## **📊 Performance Metrics**

The notebook evaluates the following:
- **Best Position:** The solution that minimizes the objective function.
- **Best Score:** The minimum value of the objective function.
- **Convergence Plot:** Shows the improvement in the best score over iterations.
