## **üìä Performance Metrics**

- **Convergence Time:** Time taken for the algorithm to reach the optimal solution.
- **Optimality Gap:** Difference between the solution found and the known optimal value.
- **Exploration vs Exploitation Balance:** Measures how well the algorithm balances exploration (discovery of new solutions) and exploitation (improvement of known solutions).
- **Accuracy:** Percentage of times the algorithm finds a near-optimal solution across multiple runs.
