## **📁 Project Structure**

- `Hopfield_Neural_Network.ipynb`: Contains the complete Python implementation, explanations, and visualizations for training and testing a Hopfield network.

---

## **🚀 What's Included**

The notebook demonstrates:
1. **Hopfield Neural Network Overview**:
   - Recurrent neural network for associative memory.
   - Energy function and stable state convergence.
2. **Python Implementation**:
   - Example of storing and recalling binary patterns using HNN.
   - Weight computation using **Hebbian learning**.
3. **Performance Metrics**:
   - Recall accuracy and convergence time.

---

## **🔧 Prerequisites**

Ensure you have the following installed:
- **Python (>= 3.7)**
- **Jupyter Notebook**
- Libraries: `numpy`, `matplotlib`

Install dependencies using:
```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib notebook
```

---

## **▶️ Running the Notebook**

1. Open the terminal and navigate to the folder containing the notebook.
2. Run the following command:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```
3. Open `Hopfield_Neural_Network.ipynb` in the browser and run each cell.

## **📊 Performance Metrics**

- **Recall Accuracy:** Percentage of times the network recalls the correct pattern.
- **Convergence Time:** Number of iterations required for the network to reach a stable state.
- **Pattern Capacity:** Number of patterns that can be stored without significant recall errors.
- **Energy Function:** Tracking the decrease in the network's energy levels during state updates.

---

## **📝 Example Overview**

- **Training Patterns:** Binary patterns ([1, -1, 1, -1] and [-1, 1, -1, 1]).
- **Recall Example:** Given a noisy input ([1, -1, 1, 1]), the network recalls the closest stored pattern ([1, -1, 1, -1]).
- **Hebbian Learning Rule:** Weights are updated as:

### **Sample Output:**
```bash
Input Pattern: [1, -1, 1, 1]
Recalled Pattern: [1, -1, 1, -1]
```
