## **üìÅ Project Structure**

- `Bayesian_Network.ipynb`: Contains the complete Python implementation, explanations, and visualizations for building a Bayesian Network and performing probabilistic inference.

---

## **üöÄ What's Included**

The notebook demonstrates:
1. **Bayesian Network Overview**:
   - Representation of variables and dependencies using Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG).
   - Joint Probability Distribution (JPD) from conditional probability tables (CPTs).
2. **Python Implementation**:
   - Example Bayesian Network for medical diagnosis using `pgmpy`.
   - Definition of nodes, edges, and conditional probability tables (CPTs).
   - Performing probabilistic inference using **Variable Elimination**.
3. **Performance Evaluation**:
   - Accuracy of predictions, log-likelihood scores, and inference time.

---

## **üîß Prerequisites**

Ensure you have the following installed:
- **Python (>= 3.7)**
- **Jupyter Notebook**
- Libraries: `numpy`, `pandas`, `pgmpy`, `matplotlib`

Install dependencies using:
```bash
pip install numpy pandas pgmpy matplotlib notebook
```

## **‚ñ∂Ô∏è Running the Notebook**

1. Open the terminal and navigate to the folder containing the notebook.
2. Run the following command:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```
3. Open `Bayesian_Network.ipynb` in the browser and run each cell.

## **üìä Performance Metrics**

- **Log-Likelihood Score:** Measures how well the network explains the observed data.
- **Accuracy:** Proportion of correct predictions for classification tasks.
- **Inference Time:** Time taken to compute posterior probabilities given evidence.
- **Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) and Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC):** Metrics to evaluate the goodness of fit while penalizing model complexity.

---

## **üìù Example Overview**

- **Bayesian Network Structure:** A simple DAG with variables "Flu," "Fever," "Cough," and "BodyAche."
- **Conditional Probability Tables (CPTs):**
  - Example: Probability of "Fever" given "Flu."
- **Inference Task:** Compute the probability of "Flu" given evidence that "BodyAche" is present.

### **Sample Query:**
For evidence:
```bash
BodyAche = True
```
The output might be:
```bash
+--------+--------------+
| Flu    | Probability  |
+--------+--------------+
| Flu(0) | 0.70         |
| Flu(1) | 0.30         |
+--------+--------------+
```
