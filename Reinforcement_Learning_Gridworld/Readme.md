## **üìÅ Project Structure**

- `Reinforcement_Learning_Gridworld.ipynb`: Contains the complete Python implementation, explanations, and visualizations for Q-Learning applied to a **Gridworld** environment.

---

## **üöÄ What's Included**

The notebook demonstrates:
1. **Reinforcement Learning Overview**:
   - Key components: Agent, Environment, States, Actions, Rewards, Policy, and Value Functions.
   - Markov Decision Process (MDP) and Bellman Equations.
   - Exploration vs Exploitation.
2. **Python Implementation**:
   - Example of **Q-Learning** applied to a 5x5 **Gridworld** task.
   - Explanation of hyperparameters such as learning rate, discount factor, and epsilon (exploration rate).
3. **Performance Evaluation**:
   - Convergence analysis, reward accumulation, and policy improvement.

## **üîß Prerequisites**

Ensure you have the following installed:
- **Python (>= 3.7)**
- **Jupyter Notebook**
- Libraries: `numpy`, `matplotlib`

Install dependencies using:
```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib notebook
```

## **‚ñ∂Ô∏è Running the Notebook**

1. Open the terminal and navigate to the folder containing the notebook.
2. Run the following command:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```
3. Open `Reinforcement_Learning_Gridworld.ipynb` in the browser and run each cell.

## **üìä Performance Metrics**

- **Cumulative Reward:** Total rewards accumulated by the agent during an episode.
- **Convergence Time:** Number of episodes required for the agent to learn an optimal policy.
- **Exploration Rate:** Percentage of exploratory actions taken.
- **Policy Robustness:** Ability of the learned policy to generalize to unseen states.

---

## **üìù Example Overview**

- **Environment:** A 5x5 **Gridworld** where the agent starts at the top-left (0, 0) and aims to reach the bottom-right (4, 4).
- **Q-Learning Parameters:**
  - **Learning Rate (Œ±):** 0.1.
  - **Discount Factor (Œ≥):** 0.9.
  - **Exploration Rate (Œµ):** 0.2.
  - **Episodes:** 500.
- **Reward Function:**
  - **+10** for reaching the goal.
  - **-1** penalty for each step taken.

### **Sample Output:**
```bash
Training Complete!
```
After training, the agent successfully reaches the goal by following an optimal path.
