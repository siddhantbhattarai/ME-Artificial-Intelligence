## **üöÄ What's Included**

The notebook demonstrates:
1. **Random Forest Algorithm Overview**:
   - Bootstrap sampling and random feature selection (feature bagging).
   - Aggregation of predictions using majority voting (classification) or averaging (regression).
2. **Python Implementations**:
   - **Classification Example:** Using the Iris dataset to classify flower species.
   - **Regression Example:** Using the California Housing dataset to predict house prices.
3. **Performance Evaluation**:
   - Accuracy, classification report, mean absolute error (MAE), mean squared error (MSE), and R¬≤ score.

## **üîß Prerequisites**

Ensure you have the following installed:
- **Python (>= 3.7)**
- **Jupyter Notebook**
- Libraries: `numpy`, `pandas`, `scikit-learn`, `matplotlib`

## **üìä Performance Metrics**

### **Classification Metrics:**
- **Accuracy:** Proportion of correctly predicted instances.
- **Precision:** Proportion of true positives out of all positive predictions.
- **Recall:** Proportion of true positives out of all actual positives.
- **F1-Score:** Harmonic mean of precision and recall.

### **Regression Metrics:**
- **Mean Absolute Error (MAE):** Average magnitude of errors between predictions and actual values.
- **Mean Squared Error (MSE):** Average of squared differences between predictions and actual values.
- **R-Squared (R¬≤):** Proportion of variance explained by the model.
